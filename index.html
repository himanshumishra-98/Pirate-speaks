        <p>Most pirates originated from Britain, so most pirates spoke English. The others spoke mostly French or Spanish. I imagine there may have also been Welsh or Scottish speakers as well. Some members of crews may have spoken Native American or African dialects, but would have had to learn another language to work on the ship properly</p>
